    Add inline comments for complex logic
    Generate HTML documentation using pydoc
    Review each other's documentation for clarity
    Identify areas needing better explanation

Expected Output:

    Well-documented code modules
    Generated HTML documentation
    List of documentation improvements needed
    Peer feedback on clarity

Discussion Points:

    What information was hardest to document?
    How do you balance detail vs. brevity?
    What would a new developer need to know?
    Which parts needed the most clarification?
