Understanding Documentation Levels:

    "Documentation exists at multiple levels, each serving different audiences and purposes:"
        Code-level documentation (docstrings, comments) - For developers
            Purpose: To explain what the code does, how it works, and why certain decisions were made
        API documentation - For developers using your code
            Purpose: To describe how to interface with your code, typically from the outside
        User documentation - For end-users of your application
            Purpose: To help users understand how to install, use, and troubleshoot the software
        System documentation - For understanding architecture
            Purpose: To provide a high-level understanding of how the system is structured and how components interact
        Process documentation - For maintenance and deployment
            Purpose: To describe the processes required for deploying, updating, and maintaining the system
