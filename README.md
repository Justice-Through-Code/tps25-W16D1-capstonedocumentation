Understanding Documentation Levels:

    "Documentation exists at multiple levels, each serving different audiences and purposes:"
        Code-level documentation (docstrings, comments) - For developers
        API documentation - For developers using your code
        User documentation - For end-users of your application
        System documentation - For understanding architecture
        Process documentation - For maintenance and deployment
